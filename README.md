# System Modelling Projects

## Overview

This repository contains Mathematica notebooks related to system modeling projects. The projects focus on analyzing and modeling dynamic systems through various mathematical methods. Each notebook addresses different aspects of system behavior, including mathematical modeling, simulation, and analysis of physical systems.

## Repository Structure

- **`Homework 1_StefanoTonini.nb`**: A Mathematica notebook focused on the initial steps in system modeling.
  
- **`Homework 2_StefanoTonini.nb`**: Builds on the concepts of dynamic systems, incorporating more complex models and simulations.

- **`Homework1_StefanoTonini218722.nb`**: Another system modeling project focused on a specific system with additional parameters for simulation and analysis.
  
- **`Homework2_StefanoTonini218722 .nb`**: A continuation of the system modeling approach with more advanced techniques.
  
- **`Homework3_StefanoTonini218722.nb`**: Final project focusing on a comprehensive system analysis, combining all learned techniques for an advanced dynamic model.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic System Modelling**: Implementation of mathematical models for dynamic systems using differential equations.
- **Simulation and Analysis**: Simulating system responses under various conditions and analyzing stability, control, and behavior.
- **Mathematica Files**: All projects are implemented in Mathematica, making use of its powerful symbolic and numerical computation capabilities.
